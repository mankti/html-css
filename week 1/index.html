  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>I am a physicist focusing on the sciences of vision. I have been a member of the Electrophysiology of Vision and Psychophysical Methods Laboratory, Laboratory of Optics and Vision, Medical School, University of Crete, since 2013. My MSc thesis concerned the effect of several optical factors on eye movements during reading. During my Phd I used eye movement analysis during reading in order to evaluate i) the effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment in AMD patients and ii) the presbyopia correction that provide monovision and multifocal contact lenses.<br><br> Apart from the study of reading behavior, my scientific interests also lie on the field of psychophysical methods (visual acuity test, contrast sensitivity, reaction times) and electrophysiology of vision (VEP, ERG, EOG) which I used for clinical and research reasons.</p>
